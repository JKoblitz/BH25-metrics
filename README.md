# Biohackathon Europe 2025 Project on KPI measurements 

In the context of the Biohackathon Europe 2025, this project aims to create a standardized ontology for Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used in life sciences services. The ontology will facilitate consistent measurement and reporting of service performance across various platforms.

It is based on a google sheet in which we have collected KPIs used by different organisations to evaluate their services that contains the following columns:

- Indicator set (Where does the indicator come from? E.g. ELIXIR-DE, etc.)
- Indicator (Name of indicator)
- Description (What does the indicator measure? )
- Service Category (e.g. Database, Web Application etc..)
- Type of indicator (Quantitative or qualitative?)
- Example (An example of the indicator in use)
- Target Group (Who is requesting the KPI?)
- Mandatory (yes/no)
- Measurement (tool/estimation etc)  (How is the indicator accessed?)
- Source (What is collected, e.g. hits, citations etc..)
- Automation possible (If yes, please name a tool that can be used )
